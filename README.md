# California Housing Prices Data Exploration

## Overview

Welcome to my **California Housing Prices Data Exploration** project! In this repository, I have conducted an in-depth analysis of housing prices in California using both a Regression algorithm and a Random Forest algorithm. This README provides a brief overview of the project and its key findings.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project were to explore the relationships between various features and housing prices in California and to compare the performance of two different machine learning algorithms—Regression and Random Forest—in predicting these prices. I have fine-tuned hyperparameters for both algorithms to optimize their predictive capabilities.
